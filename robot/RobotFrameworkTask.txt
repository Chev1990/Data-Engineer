Hello Robot framework(RF) task

In this task you will create a project for running RF and perform basic testing of data from "AdventureWorks2012" database via SQL statements (also you can use DB "TRN" from Module 1).

# Task:
1. Create 2 DIFFERENT test cases for data checks on "AdventureWorks2012" database (3 different tables) and document them (name, steps, expected results).
Example TC#1 count for column; TC#2 average function for column, TC#3 max\min values, TC#4 values in range of list ...... etc.
Tables to use:
-[Person].[Address]
-[Production].[Document]
-[Production].[UnitMeasure]
As a result you should have 6 different test cases for 3 different tables (2 per table).
2. Create a project for running RF tests.
3. Automate test cases from step 1 so that they can connect to MS SQL DB from SQL Module on your localhost.
4. Store a test report.

# Expected output:
Git project on git.epam.com with test cases file, code project and test report example.
Please write a meaningfull Readme file, that will help to understand how anyone can use what you have done.
